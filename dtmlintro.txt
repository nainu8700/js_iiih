Why Use DHTML?
DHTML makes a webpage dynamic but Javascript also does, the question arises that what different does DHTML do? So the answer is that DHTML has the ability to change a webpages look, content and style once the document has loaded on our demand without changing or deleting everything already existing on the browserâ€™s webpage. DHTML can change the content of a webpage on demand without the browser having to erase everything else, i.e. 
being able to alter changes on a webpage even after the document has completely loaded.

User time is saved by sending less number of requests to the server. As it is possible to modify and replace elements even after a page is loaded, it is not required to create separate pages for changing styles which in turn saves time in building pages and also reduces the number of requests that are sent to the server.
